3.Read about the difference between window screen and document in javascript:-

Document
The Document interface is the one which represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content,which is the DOM tree. 
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object(DOM).
It is the root node of the whole HTML document.

Window
The JavaScript window object(BOM) sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser window. 
The window object is supported by all browsers.
All the JavaScript's objects, functions, and variables automatically become members of the window object.
The window object represents the current browsing context . It holds things like window.location, window.history, window.screen, window.status, or the window.document

Screen
Screen is the small information object about physical screen dimensions like height, width, ect...
It can be used to display screen width, height, etc..
